Try experimenting with md files, for example by checking out the [README](/README.md).

The .md file extension tells us that the contents of the file contains markdown. 
Markdown is a simple language that lets us easily format text. It can also be parsed into HTML. Try using `backticks` around text, and notice that it formats the text to look like code. This can be done inline, or to designate a code block like below:
```javascript
const markupJavaScriptExample(foo) {
  // returns the parameter
  return foo;
};
```
In the block above, we specified the language to be javascript.
Notice that the [README](/README.md) file uses an unordered, bulleted list which serves as a table of contents. Here is an example of an ordered list:
1. This is
2. an ordered
3. list.

Make sure to leave an empty line between the list and what follows. For more tips, check out this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)!
